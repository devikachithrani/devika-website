My project focuses on improving chemotherapeutic drug delivery to the tumour using gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Paclitaxel - a common chemotherapeutic in the clinic used to treat breast and pancreatic cancer - is highly toxic due to the required solvent to disolve the drug. Additionally, very limited paclitaxel resolves in the tumoru tissue after injection, resulting in significant off-target dose and toxicity. Paclitaxel can be bound to the surface of GNPs that can then be disolved in non-toxic solutions such as water. Furthermore, GNPs can preferentially target malignant tissue and thus could improve drug delivery to the tumour, reducing toxic effects and improving therapeutic efficacy.
