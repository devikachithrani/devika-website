My unique multidisciplinary academic background solidified my ambition to overcome humanityâ€™s deadliest disease; i.e. cancer. The approach is to fight cancer using combined modality that not only involves radiotherapy but also nanotechnology and other therapeutic drugs. The aim is to develop an in vitro co-culture environment that mimics the in vivo tumor microenvironment. The application will involve modeling the complexity of cancer in a 3D bio-printed structure and analyzing the effectiveness of such targeted therapy. The project will accelerate transitioning from cell culture preclinical studies to animal models and eventually to clinical trials.
