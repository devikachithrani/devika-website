Dose escalation required to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy is limited due to normal tissue toxicity. Therefore, by locally enhancing the radiotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, it can improve the quality of treatment. My research aims to exploit nanoparticle systems to target and increase the radiosensitivity of cancer cells by using a unique combination of physical and drug based radiosensitizers in hopes to preferentially increase the radiotherapeutic effect experienced by cancer cells.
