Graduate student at the University of Victoria, concentrating on the use of Gold Nanoparticles in translation from a two dimensional monolayer model to a three dimensional spheroid model. This can allow for a better approximation of the in vivo environment present in the tumor microenvironment, hopefully facilitating an improved translation, in terms of results and speed, of preclinical data to the clinic.
