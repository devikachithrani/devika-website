My project focuses on the implementation of gold nanoparticles as radiosensitizing agents in conjunction with chemotherapeutics cabazitaxel and paclitaxel into high dose rate brachytherapy. The dual administration of the gold nanoparticles with the chemotherapeutics can elicit greater radiosensitization, greatly improving therapeutic outcomes for patients.
