Congratulations to Daniel on publishing his first review article with our lab. The title of the article is "Improving the Efficacy of Common Cancer Treatments via Targeted Therapeutics towards the Tumour and Its Microenvironment". Daniel worked very hard to achieve this accomplishment in a short amount of time. Thank you to our co-authors for their help with proofreading and reviewing the manuscript prior to submission.
