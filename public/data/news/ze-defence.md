Congratulations Ze on defending his PhD thesis! The thesis was very well written and accepted with just editorial changes. Over his time in the lab, he published 6 first-author papers, one book chapter, and 5 co-author publications. He will be continuing his post-doc work in Dr. Pieter Cullis's lab. Good luck, Dr. Alhussan!
