Congratulations to Daniel Cecchi and our team for publishing a significant article in ACS Applied Nano Materials titled "Route of Administration of Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles Improves Tumor Accumulation In Vivo." The study demonstrates that the route of administration critically affects the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles, especially when surface-functionalized with RGD or PEG. Intravenous injection of RGD-GNPs reduces tumor accumulation due to immune recognition, while intratumoral injection enhances tumor retention and reduces clearance in phagocytic organs. These results highlight the importance of optimizing surface ligands based on delivery method and suggest further research into alternative targeting strategies to improve tumor delivery.
