We have received funding for 5 years from Canadian Institute of Heath Research (CIHR). We will continue our nanomedicinal approach to improve current cancer therapeutics. I have a very good team of collaborators from university of British Columbia, BC Cancer (Vancouver and Victoria), McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, and Harvard Medical School. I also like to thank our industry partner, Integrated Therapeutics. We have an amazing partnership. Our team consists of medical physicists, radiation oncologists, biologists, chemists, and biomedical scientists. I like to thank all of my collaborators and my students for their dedication and hard-work. Our ultimate goal is to get this technology to the clinic sooner.
