World Health Day, celebrated every year on April 7, is a global health awareness day that aims to raise awareness around various health issues. I am very grateful to be highlighted among 4 other faculty members across faculty of science. We are developing new therapeutics and treatments for diseases, uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which viruses and bacteria are operating, evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions, uncovering the physiology of diseases and much more.
This World Health Day, explore some of the health-related research happening in our Faculty, across five of our six departments.
I am grateful for the funding from Canadian Institute of Health Research, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and Networks of centers of Excellence.
