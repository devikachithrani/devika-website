We are excited to share Nolan Jackson’s latest article titled "Comprehensive analysis of the tumor targeting efficiency of functionalized nanoparticles in an immunocompetent environment." You can read the full paper here: <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-22151-7">10.1038/s41598-025-22151-7</a>. Congratulations to Nolan Jackson and our dedicated team, including radiation oncologists, medical physicists, biomedical scientists, and immunologists, for their outstanding work.

The effectiveness of nanoparticles (NPs) is mostly evaluated using immunocompromised mouse models. While these models are valuable, they do not fully capture immune-related interactions, which can lead to an overestimation of targeting efficiency. In our study, we explored the use of RGD peptides to enhance the tumor accumulation of PEGylated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) within an immunocompetent mouse model. Our results reveal that RGD functionalization can facilitate immune-driven clearance in vivo, even though it improves GNP uptake by cancer cells in vitro. This underscores the crucial need to assess nanoparticle targeting strategies in immunocompetent models for more accurate, physiologically relevant insights.
