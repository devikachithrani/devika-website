Congratulations to Kyle for publishing his final paper with us:
Kyle's PhD work involved two fronts: a) building of 3D tumor spheroid model that can better mimic a real tumour microenvironment, and b) use of this 3D tumor model to study novel cancer therapeutics. He explored the effect of the combination of GNPs and docetaxel (DTX) with radiotherapy (RT) as a novel treatment option in cancer radiotherapy.
The results showed that GNPs decreased the surviving cells by 10.54–15.61% compared to control, while GNPs and DTX decreased survival by 20.9–31.04%. It is also noted that there is reduced spheroid volume 14 days after treatment with the triple combination.
Therefore, combining GNPs and DTX leads to a synergistic radiosensitization effect in spheroids, which can better mimic the tumour microenvironment. Testing treatment modalities with spheroids and RT may allow a quicker translation to the clinic.
