We are excited to share our work with the team at Integrated Nanotherapeutics Inc (https://integratedntx.com/) and BC Cancer. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of using lipid nanoparticles to deliver radiosensitizing drugs such docetaxel. Our goal is to bring this innovative technology to market as quickly as possible. We believe that this novel approach has the potential to significantly benefit cancer patients.
