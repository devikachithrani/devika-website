Congratulations to Abdulaziz for his published work on three-dimensional co-culture model. He focused on Pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer stands among the deadliest forms of cancer, and the existing treatments fall short of providing adequate efficacy. Novel and more effective treatment approaches are urgently required to address this critical medical challenge. In this latest study, we have developed a more clinically relevant 3D pancreatic cancer co-culture spheroid model using both tumor cells and patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs promote tumor growth and we want to make sure we not only destroy tumor cells but also reduce the activity of CAFs so that it cannot promote tumor growth anymore. The combination of GNPs with RT demonstrated remarkable radiosensitization effects, representing a promising approach to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. These effects were particularly noteworthy in the more treatment-resistant co-culture spheroid model.
