We are excited to share Daniel Cecchi's latest article title "Radiotherapeutic efficacy of gold nanoparticles for high dose-rate brachytherapy compared to conventional radiotherapy: An in vitro study" has been successfully published in Medical Physics. You can read about it here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.18006">10.1002/mp.18006</a>

The study focuses on the comparison of gold nanoparticle radiosensitization in two different irradiation environments: high dose rate brachytherapy and high-energy external beam radiotherapy.
