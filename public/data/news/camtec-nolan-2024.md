We had a great time at the first ever symposium being held by the Centre for Advanced Materials and Technology at University of Victoria! Nolan Jackson (PhD student) from our lab gave an invited talk on our cancer nanotechnology research program. I am so fortunate to have a really good graduate and undergraduate students who can step up and shine in front of our research community.
