Congratulations to Nolan for his published work on combined cancer therapy. Incorporating docetaxel (DTX) to work in unison with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and radiation increased the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) treatment. Our latest in vivo results displayed significant reduction in tumor growth over a 30-day observation period with the treatment of GNP/DTX/RT when compared to GNP/RT after a single 5 Gy dose (with 6 MeV linac). Our combined treatment (GNP/DTX/RT) strategy resulted in 100% mice survival in contrast to GNP/RT or DTX/RT. Our study suggests that the treatment strategy could improve tumor control through local dose enhancement. As the concentrations of GNPs and DTX used in this study are clinically feasible, there is potential for this strategy to be translated into clinical settings.
This is Nolan's second paper as the first author in less than a year. He just transferred from MSc to a PhD. He attended his first medical physics conference, COMP (Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists) and won the best oral presentation award as well. I am confident that he will be a great scientist one day. He is working on a very exciting project for his PhD.
